# Weatheroo

exercise:

1. own authentication
2. adding cities by users
3. fetching forecasts from Open Weather Map API

### Setup

##### clone
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ToTenMilan/Weatheroo.git
```

##### go to directory and run setup
```
bin/setup
```

This will take time, since there are ~200000 cities to load

Built on Ruby 2.5.3, but feel free to test on any other.

Remember to put your Open Weather Map API token to `.env`.
